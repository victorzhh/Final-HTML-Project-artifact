    <h2>What your answers say about you</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You hate the planet</li>
            <ol>
                <li>There is evidence saying that climate change is real</li>
                <li>By not listening to the evidence, you refuse to take action against climate change</li>
                <li>Therefore, you hate the planet</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        <li>You are likely a Republican</li>
            <ol>
                <li>More Republicans than Democrats deny climate change</li>
                <li>That is not to say most Republicans deny climate change, that is not true</li>
                <li>Since you deny it, you are likely a Republican</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        <li>You are likely old</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Old people are more likely to deny climate change than young people</li>
                <li>That is because young people will experience more of the negative effects of climate change as old people do not have much time left on this planet</li>
                <li>Since you deny climate change, you are likely old</li>
            </ol>
